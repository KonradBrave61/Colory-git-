# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section
#====================================================================================================

## user_problem_statement: 
First analyze the code than proced with the prompt 
1.User should be able to change 
Status of the team from Public to Private at any time 
Change Favorite Formation to favourite Team 
Name of the team Should be able to change 
2. When saving the team there should be a window that pop up and in that window user should be able to add team name and pick a slot on which he can save the team make 2 buttons one for creating a new save like + and one to overwrite the already saved team after which will the selector of the already saved team will show up .
Key players change to info/discription of the team the  creator should be able to create and edit the info at any time 
Add followers and following for people to be able to see who they follow and who is following them 
Rating of the published team should be based on people opinion make a rating with like 6things to rate out like tension usage, difficulty ,fun and stop with this rn 
Add the page for people to view the others teams and add some comments in it 
And first ofc load the code

Changed grid layout to: Left panel (controls) | Formation field (2 columns) | Bench (right side). Added mt-16 to bench Card for perfect vertical alignment with pitch content. Updated bench styling with optimized height calculations: minimized header space, CardContent uses calc(100%-2.5rem), and each slot takes calc(20%-0.5rem) for perfect 5-slot distribution. Bench now perfectly matches pitch height (600px) and vertical position alignment. Final bench design achieves exact height and position alignment with the pitch."
